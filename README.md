### Hi there, Devika this side 👋
Welcome to the world of "Nyx's Creative work place" ! 
I am a computer science student passionate about building intelligent applications with AI and Machine Learning.

I'm a perfectionist at heart, always striving to polish my code and documentation before a final release—but you can track my completed and in-progress work below.

My pinned repositories (GOKEY, Amazon-ML-Challenge) are a selection of my completed public projects. Other key projects are kept in private repositories during active development.

    🌱 Currently Building (Private):

        SEYA: An audio-based AI safety app (currently in the prototyping phase).

        Penumbra: A new horror-themed text adventure game using Streamlit and Groq.

    🏆 Completed Projects (Public):

        GOKEY: My completed internship project, a document-based AI QnA app.

        Amazon-ML-Challenge: The model that placed me in the top 0.9% of the competition.

        EPOCH : Email Agent

I'm currently polishing the code and writing detailed documentation for all my projects before their final public release. Thanks for visiting!
